**Neural Network architecture**

A convolutional neural network for Fashion MNist dataset, with training accuracy of 92%.  
It contains 128 filters of size 3 * 3, and has 128 dense layers.
In addition, it has the learning rate of 0.001 with 20 epoches, and each layer is followed by pooling and dropout layers.  


## What I learned
* Designing of a simple Convolutional neural network
* Realisation of training and validation trade-off
* Balancing different parameters for best accuracy without overfitting
