Performs image recognition to classify Zalando's Fashion-MNIST dataset with 92% accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network is powered by tensorflow and keras libraries.



## âž° Project Duration
November 2019 - December 2019



## ðŸŽ¨ Features / ì£¼ìš” ê¸°ëŠ¥
- [x] **Design a Convolutional Neural Network** - combination of convolutional, polling, dropout, and dense layers to design a small and deep neural network.
  - It contains 128 filters of size 3 * 3, and has 128 dense layers.
  - In addition, it has the learning rate of 0.001 with 20 epoches, and each layer is followed by pooling and dropout layers.  


## ðŸ’¡ Result

### 1. Effect of a Learning Rate
**Learning rate**, a hyper-parameter, controls how much we are adjusting the weights of our network.
- **High learning rate** may fail to converge as gradient descent can overshoot the minimum
- On the other hand, **small learning rate** can take too long to converge, but is more resistant to noise and inaccuracies. Hence, finding a moderate learning rate is desirable.

**Most appropriate learning rate= 0.001**

</p>

- The learning rate that is considered the most appropriate was found to be **0.001**. Both the training and validation loss is low, hence is stable and resistant to errors and inaccuracies.
- It satisfies to be small enough to not diverge, but big enough classify correctly without overfitting.


### 2. The Neural Network Architecture

In the first part of the model, it **extracts the features using convolutional filters**. This is done in the **Conv2D, MaxPooling2D and Dropout layers**, as it can be seen in the figure above.

The second part of the model **performs the classification**, where it maps the identifies features to a specific class, which in this architecture, is done in **two dense layers.**

In between these layers are the **Flatten layer**, which has no effect on the input size, but **makes it a one single layer.**


#### Training & Validation graph

The final model generally achieves a good fit, with both accuracy and loss curves converging (figure above). The graph suggests that the model has the ability to generalize and classify unseen data correctly.
