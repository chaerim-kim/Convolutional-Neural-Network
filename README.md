# Convolutional-Neural-Network

A convolutional neural network for Fashion MNist dataset, with training accuracy of 92%.  
It contains 128 filters of size 3 * 3, and has 128 dense layers.
In addition, it has the learning rate of 0.001 with 20 epoches, and each layer is followed by pooling and dropout layers.

## What I learned
- Designing of a Convolutional Neural Network; with combination of convolutional, polling, dropout, and dense layers to design small but deep neural network.
- Experimenting with different architectural parameters to identify the best Neural Network for certain data set - to aim for best accuracy, without overfitting.
- Realisation of training and validation trade-off.
